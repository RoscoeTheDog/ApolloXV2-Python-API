# ApolloXV2 Python API
 A python API wrapper for the ApolloXV2 defi derivatives exchange

![image](https://github.com/RoscoeTheDog/ApolloXV2-Python-API/assets/54086262/d810942f-c0bb-4610-ac65-32727fd07a43)

ApolloXV2 is a great bsc on-chain solution for trading; with better features improving on its V1 predecesor which lets you manage risk better. Use 1-1001x leverage (depending on the market). Provide more than just stablecoins as collateral to trade with. Trades settle directly to your hotstorage wallet to reduce unncesssary exposure.

**Known-issues:**
+ Not all tokens have been wrapped as a `BaseBSCToken` class in the `defi/tokens/bsc.py` module. it may need expanding on especially as more markets are released.

This wrapper provides a python interface to ApolloxXV2 perp smart contracts [found here](https://github.com/apollox-finance/apollox-perp-contracts/tree/60638b7479362a1a1ac1bb3fead020c5082fe4cd/contracts). 
All essential methods to implement a strategy have been wrapped, while nonessentials have been ommited due to lack of a practical need.

You can read, create, limit, cancel, close, history, etc. The only thing not implemented currently is adding margin to existing trades (TBD).


Example usage.
```python
from apolloxV2 import ApolloXV2
from defi.tokens.bsc import *

# credentials are required for most operations. some few read commands exist
params = {
 'wallet_address': 'user_wallet_address',
 'private_key': 'user_private_key'
}

# to read markets from exchange
APX = ApolloXV2
print(APX.pairs_v3())

# token metadata contained in defi/tokns/bsc.py
print(BSC.ADDRESS)
print(USDT.ADDRESS)

# CREATE ORDERS V2
# set collateral and trading tokens
base_token = tokens.bsc.BTC
collateral_token = tokens.bsc.ETH
# specify order type
order_type = 'create_limit_order'

print('fetching base token ticker...')
fetched = False
base_price = None
base_decimals = None
while not fetched:
    try:
        base_price, base_decimals = APX.fetch_ticker(tokens.bsc.BTC)
        fetched = True
    except Exception as e:
        pass

print('fetching collateral token ticker...')
fetched = False
collateral_price = None
collateral_decimals = None
while not fetched:
    try:
        collateral_price, collateral_decimals = APX.fetch_ticker(collateral_token)
        fetched = True
    except Exception as e:
        pass

'''
   In this example we'll use about $13 of eth (0.055) as margin with 20x leverage to open a ~$200+ long position on BTC-USD.
